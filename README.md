# AutoML
It automates the process of creating the model. Feeding your dataset into an AutoML tool, which will automatically split the data into training and testing sets, preprocess the data, and then try out multiple machine learning algorithms (such as decision trees, neural networks, and random forests) to see which one performs best on your dataset.
